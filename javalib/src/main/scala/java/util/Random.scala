  /* Implementation Note:
   *   The two private methods nextInt(origin, bound) and
   *   nextLong(origin, bound) use the algorithms documented by
   *   JDK 8.
   *
   *   The same basic algorithms are implemented in the JSR-166 code
   *   in the Scala Native code for java.util.concurrent.
   *
   *   This class is documented as requiring the capability of setting
   *   a "seed" value for the random number generator.  The JSR-166
   *   code does not allow that.  So these two methods can not delegate
   *   to the corresponding JSR-166 methods.  That would be too easy, by far.
   *
   *   Anyone interested in robust code will note that these methods
   *   use unbounded "while" loops. Those loops are in the original
   *   algorithms. Yes, including the JSR-166 code. Such unbounded
   *   loops can easily become what appear to be time consuming if not
   *   infinite loops.
   *
   *   TL; DR
   *      Each of the loops will terminate but have a worst case which can
   *      take substantial time.
   */

  /*   The int while() loop will terminate but has poor worst case performance.
   *   By the pigeon hole principle of discrete math, we know that the
   *   maximum number of iterations for an int is abs(jl.Integer.MIN_VALUE).
   *   A noticeable but finite pause.
   *
   *   The expected behavior is more acceptable. The probability of a
   *   "successful draw" for any one draw is
   *   (nInBounds/(abs(MIN_VALUE) + MAX_VALUE)). Call this probSuccess.
   *   probFailure is (1 - probSuccess).
   *   For a series of n draws, the probability of overall success is
   *   (1 - exp(probFailure), n)). For 10 draws, the probability of success
   *   is greater than 0.999.

   * from there. Same algorithm as Java code but already in Scala.
   */

  /*  The long while() loop will terminate but has poor worst case performance.
   *  It is more difficult to analyze. The JSR-166 algorithm
   *  documents that nextLong() might not return all possible long values.
   *
   *  With a range where "bound - origin" is 1 and that value is exactly one of
   *  the values which nextLong() could not return, the loop would not
   *  terminate.
   *
   *  However, the while() loop is called only when the range
   *  is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE. The probability of nextLong() not being
   *  able to return _any_ of those values is vanishing low.
   *  From there, the reasoning is similar to the ints case, but with
   *  larger values.
   *  In particular, the denominator for probSuccess is much larger, making
   *  the probability of success on any given draw smaller. That, in turn,
   *  requires a larger number of draws for a given overall probability of
   *  success.
   *
   *  The worst case could look like a "busy wait" non-terminating loop.
